# Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering - The Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Index Analysis 2019 - By David Salako.


## Background and Context


Created in 1995 by the Heritage Foundation, The Index of Economic Freedom is a ranking created to measure the economic freedom in the countries of the world.

Now, in its 25th edition, The Economic Freedom Index is poised to help readers track over two decades of the advancement in economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity and promote these ideas in their homes, schools, and communities.

The Index covers 12 freedoms, from property rights to financial freedom, in 186 countries.

This dataset belongs to The Heritage Foundation and is freely available to download on their website (https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking).

The Index of Economic Freedom considers every component equally important in achieving the positive benefits of economic freedom.

Each freedom is weighted equally in determining country scores.

Countries considering economic reforms may find significant opportunities for improving economic performance in those factors in which they score the lowest.

These factors may indicate significant binding constraints on economic growth and prosperity.
